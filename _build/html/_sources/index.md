# Stochastic Growth and Long-Run Risk 


This notebook serves as an example from {cite:ps}`hansen2021risk`. It displays computational results of an AK model with adjustment cost, with capital and endogenously determined long-run risk. This model is inspired in part by {cite:ts}`eberlywang`, but includes a habit persistence process for technology. The model is approximately solved using a small noise expansion technique as in {cite:ts}`lombardouhlig`.

This notebook is mainly for illustration of model specific results. If interested in more general computation details, users can refer to the Computational Details notebook accompanying this notebook.
